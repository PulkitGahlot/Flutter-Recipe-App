# Meals App | Flutter Recipe Guide

A dynamic and intuitive Flutter application for discovering and organizing meal recipes. This app provides a seamless user experience for browsing meals by category, viewing detailed cooking instructions, managing a personal list of favorite meals, and filtering recipes based on dietary preferences. It serves as an excellent example of a well-structured Flutter application, effectively utilizing the Riverpod package for state management.

## üìñ About The Project

The Meals App is designed to be a simple yet feature-rich mobile guide for recipes. The main screen features a tab-based navigation system allowing users to switch between meal categories and their saved favorites.

- In the **Categories** tab, users can explore various food types like 'Italian', 'Asian', and 'Quick & Easy'. Selecting a category displays a list of corresponding meals.
- In the **Favorites** tab, users can see all the meals they've marked with a star.
- From any meal list, users can tap a recipe to view a detailed screen with ingredients, step-by-step instructions, and the option to add/remove it from favorites.

A key feature is the powerful filtering system, accessible from a side drawer, which allows users to tailor the meal listings to their specific dietary needs, including gluten-free, lactose-free, vegetarian, and vegan options.

This project is built with a focus on clean code, scalability, and efficient state management using the Flutter Riverpod package.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Tabbed Navigation:** A `BottomNavigationBar` allows easy switching between the main "Categories" screen and the "Favorites" screen.
-   **Drawer for Filters:** A `Drawer` provides access to the dedicated Filters screen without cluttering the main UI.
-   **Browse by Category:** Meals are neatly organized into categories, displayed in an animated grid layout.
-   **Detailed Meal View:** A dedicated screen for each meal shows a hero image, ingredients, and preparation steps.
-   **Favorites System:** Users can add or remove any meal from their favorites list with a single tap. The favorite status is persisted across the app.
-   **Advanced Filtering:** A dedicated filters screen allows users to apply dietary restrictions. The app dynamically updates the list of available meals based on the selected filters.
-   **State Management with Riverpod:** Leverages Riverpod for a reactive and robust state management architecture, separating business logic from the UI.
-   **Engaging UI/UX:** Incorporates multiple animations, including:
    -   `SlideTransition` for the categories screen entrance.
    -   `Hero` animations for smooth image transitions between the meals list and details screen.
    -   `AnimatedSwitcher` and `RotationTransition` for the favorite icon's state change.

## üí° Core Concepts Illustrated

### State Management with Riverpod

The app showcases several powerful features of Riverpod:

-   **`Provider`**: Used in `meals_provider.dart` for providing a static, read-only list of data (`dummyMeals`).
-   **`StateNotifierProvider`**: Implemented in `favorites_provider.dart` and `filters_provider.dart` to manage mutable state. This allows the UI to react to changes, such as adding a meal to favorites or toggling a filter.
-   **Computed/Combined Providers**: The `filteredMealsProvider` in `filters_provider.dart` is a brilliant example of a computed provider. It `watch`es both the `mealsProvider` and the `filtersProvider`. Whenever the active filters change, this provider automatically re-evaluates and returns a new, filtered list of meals, which the UI then displays.

### Navigation & UI

-   **Tab-Based Layout**: The main `TabsScreen` uses a `BottomNavigationBar` to manage the two primary user-facing screens.
-   **Hero Animations**: The `Hero` widget is used in `meal_item.dart` and `meal_details.dart` to create a beautiful and seamless transition. The meal image appears to fly from the list screen to the details screen, providing a professional feel.
-   **Reusable Widgets**: Components like `MealItem` and `MealItemTrait` are designed to be reusable, promoting a clean and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) codebase.
